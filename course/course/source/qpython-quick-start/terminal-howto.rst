* open additional terminals by tapping the plus button 
* Switch terminal by click the drop-down list on the upper left corner, click the "X" to close the terminal
* Long clicking on the terminal window, you could complete the complex operations like select text, copy all, paste, send control key, send fn key from the popup menu.
