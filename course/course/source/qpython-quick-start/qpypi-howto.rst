QPYPI howto
=============
Third party libraries could extend your programming abilities upto a greater extent, QPython manages libraries through QPYPI, There are some ways to use QPYPI as well.

Tools
-------
Tools category contains the useful tools for QPython, which could help you install QPython applications (Like SQLMap tool, Fabric tool and so on) easily, offer help for programming (Like django manage script, QEditor WebApp, Scapy tool and so on), and we will keep to improve more tools.

By using QPython's built in pip console, you could install many Python libraries, it can help you install many pure-python libraries (including the dependencies).

Notice: Some libraries mixed with c/c++ files can not be install through pip console for the android lacks the compiler environment, you could ask for help from qpython developer team.

Libraries
----------
In libraries, you can manage some Python libraries which are directly maintained by QPython team. There are some libraries which you can not install with pip console, or that are written in c/c++ code that can not be compiled on android. Like kivy, paramiko, PIL, tornado etc. You can install them easily from here.

AIPY Libraries
------------------
In AIPY libraries, QPython team has added the AI related programming libraries (like neural network, deeplearnning, data analysis and mathematical operation etc.), which help users to start the AI program learning with QPython's help easliy.

Manage Manually
-----------------
Besides these ways above, you could copy libraries into the /sdcard/qpython/lib/python2.7/site-packages in your device to install them.
